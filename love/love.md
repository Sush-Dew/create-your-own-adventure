Love is universal, some say, [French] (../french/feu-de-camp.md) is the language of love. 

Do I agree?
yes i do agree ....
I fell in love when i was in class 10th with my best friend 
he was so cute and very much humble to me


well love is not only limited to just having a boyfriend or a girlfriend ...
it is much more than that

love is eternal..
our parents love us ..
people surrounding us love us...
love is a feeling which is adorable ....
